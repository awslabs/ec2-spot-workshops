## Ec2 Spot Workshops

Collection of workshops to demonstrate best practices in using Amazon EC2 Spot Instances. https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/

Website for this workshops is available at https://ec2spotworkshops.com

## Building the Workshop site

The content of the workshops is built using [hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

### Local Build
To build the content
 * clone this repository
 * [install hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/)
 * The project uses [hugo learn](https://github.com/matcornic/hugo-theme-learn/) template as a git submodule. To update the content, execute the following code
```bash
pushd themes/learn
git submodule init
git submodule update --checkout --recursive
popd
```
 * Run hugo to generate the site, and point your browser to http://localhost:1313
```bash
hugo serve -D
```

### Containerized Development

The image can also serve as a development environment using [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).
The following command will spin up a container exposing the website at [localhost:1313](http://localhost:1313) and mount `config.toml` and the directories `./content`, `./layouts` and `./static`, so that local changes will automatically be picked up by the development container.

```
$ docker-compose up -d  ## To see the logs just drop '-d'
Starting ec2-spot-workshops_hugo_1 ... done
```
