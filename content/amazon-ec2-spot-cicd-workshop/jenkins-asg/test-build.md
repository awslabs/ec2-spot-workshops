As alluded to in the previous section, you'll need to configure your build jobs so that they are executed on the build agents running in your Spot instances. In addition, you could configure jobs to execute concurrent builds if necessary - this will help you in testing the scale-out of your fleet.

1. Go back to the Jenkins home screen and **repeat the following for each of the five Apache build projects** that are configured in your Jenkins instance:
    1. Click on the title of the build job and then click on the **Configure** link toward the left side of the screen;
    2. In the General section, click on the **Execute concurrent builds if necessary** checkbox and the **Restrict where this project can be run** checkbox. Next, enter **spot-agents** as the Label Expression (Note: if you select the auto-complete option instead of typing out the full label, Jenkins will add a space to the end of the label - be sure to remove any trailing spaces from the label before proceeding);
    3. Click on the **Save** button towards the bottom of the screen.

## Test Spot Builds and Scale-out
Now itâ€™s time to test out how Jenkins handles pushing builds to spot instances running build agents at scale. There are two things that you'll want to verify here; that your builds run successfully on the Spot instances, and that your ASG scales out when there are build jobs queued for more than a few minutes.

1. Go Back to the Jenkins home page, click on the **Schedule a Build** icon (which looks like a play symbol) for each of the five Apache projects, starting from the **Apache PDFBox** project and working upward. This will queue up five build jobs, this will trigger the EC2 Fleet plugin to start launching build agents using Spot instances;
2. When any of the build jobs have been completed, click on the **Schedule a Build** icon corresponding to that job to re-add it back to the build queue - the intent here is to keep the build queue populated with a backlog of build jobs until your Auto Scaling group has scaled out and build jobs are executing on Spot instances;
3. After around four minutes, the **EC2 Fleet Status** reported to the left of the screen will increment the **target** count to 5, indicating that the plugin has requested a scale-out action from the plugin. After a few moments, five build instances will appear in the **Build Executor Status**, though these build agents will initially appear to be offline. Once the instances have had the chance to complete the launch and bootstrapping processes (which takes around two minutes), your Jenkins Master will deploy the build agent to them via SSH, and it will come online and process the next build jobs in the queue. Once you have concurrent builds being executed on the Spot instances, you can stop adding build jobs to the build queue;
4. After a period of around a five minutes, after your builds have completed, the Spot instances should be terminated by the plugin.

If the build agents are keep showing as `offline`, make sure that you've configured correctly the SSH key pair in the credentials section when configuring the EC2 Fleet plugin. You can click on the agent to open the logs and see why it's not coming online.
