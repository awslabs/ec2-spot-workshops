By default, all job builds will be executed on the same instance that Jenkins is running on. This results in a couple of less-than-desirable behaviours:
* When CPU-intensive builds are being executed, there may not be sufficient system resources to display the Jenkins server interface; and
* The Jenkins server is often provisioned with more resources than the server interface requires in order to allow builds to execute. When builds are not being executed, these server resources are essentially going to waste.

To address these behaviours, Jenkins provides the capability to execute builds on external hosts (called build agents). Further, AWS provides a Jenkins plugin to allow Jenkins to scale out a fleet of EC2 instances in order to execute build jobs on. This lab will focus on implementing EC2 Spot build agents, showcasing what a batch processing workload typically looks like when using Amazon EC2 Spot instances.
