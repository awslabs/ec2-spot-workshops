First, you did great! Let us go over what we learned today...

## Summary

With this workshop, we learned how to install and configure Nextflow for genomics pipelines and how to use AWS Batch and Amazon EC2 Spot capacity to improve cost efficiency of these pipelines.

Let's see how cost efficient is to use Spot for Nextflow Genomic pipelines

## Cost Optimisation

Head to the EC2 Dashboard and find the Spot Request section.

Here you can check how much you safed throughout the workshop by running the job-queue on EC2 Spot instances.

## Follow Up

Now that you know how to use Nextflow and AWS Spot and AWS Batch, you can build your own custom pipelines.
