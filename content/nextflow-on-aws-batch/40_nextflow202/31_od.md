## Create EC2 On-Demand Compute Environment

Similar to what we did for the **spot-ce** used by the **job-queue** we are going to create a Compute Environment which uses a couple of large instances to run the Nextflow process within a AWS Batch job.

### Setup Compute Environment

Similar to the spot environment, we choose a name (**[1]**), select the roles (**[2]** & **[3]**). As we do not need access to a local `aws-cli` we can keep the standard ECS image.

In the second section we select **On-Demand[1]** as the provisioning model. As this compute environment is only running supervising Nextflow processes, we do not ne and pick some `large` instances as this compute environment (**[2]**).
Furthermore, we are going to to choose the `BEST FIT PROGRESSIVE` (**[3]**) as it will react to failures to acquire capacity.

We leave most of the defaults, set the **minimal and desired vCPUs to 1 [1]**.

We keep the defaults, add a tag so that we can identify the compute-environment in the third section and click **create [1]**.
