The [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/) allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text.

1. Log into the Jupyter Notebook using the **Jupyter** URL output from the CloudFormation Template using the password you configured when building the stack. 

2. Click on the notebook named [*monte-carlo-workshop.ipynb*](https://github.com/aws-samples/ec2-spot-montecarlo-workshop/blob/master/src/monte-carlo-workshop.ipynb) and it should open in a new tab.

3. Follow the instructions in the Notebook to complete Lab 2. If you're new to Jupyter, you press shift-enter to run code and/or proceed to the next section. When you're done with the Notebook, return here and we'll take the concepts we learned in this lab and build our own automated pipeline.

**You've completed Lab 2, Congrats!**
