## Overview

Amazon EC2 Spot Instances are spare compute capacity in the AWS Cloud
available to you at steep discounts compared to On-Demand prices. EC2
Spot enables you to optimize your costs on the AWS cloud and scale your
applicationâ€™s throughput up to 10X for the same budget.

This lab will walk you through the APIs and commands used to create EC2 Spot Instances: you will create an EC2 Launch Template, and then use this Launch Template to launch EC2 Spot Instances using: Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups, EC2 Spot Fleet, EC2 Fleet and the EC2 RunInstances API.

## So which of these methods should I use in my application?
For most workloads and scenarios the answer will be Auto Scaling groups. With the launch of [EC2 Auto Scaling Groups With Multiple Instance Types & Purchase Options] (https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-ec2-auto-scaling-groups-with-multiple-instance-types-purchase-options/), it has become a feature-rich tool for building applications on EC2 using Spot Instances, with allocation strategies as capacity-optimized.
