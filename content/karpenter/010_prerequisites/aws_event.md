### Login to the AWS Workshop Portal

If you are at an AWS event, an AWS account was created for you to use throughout the workshop. You will need the **Event access code** provided to you by the event's organizers.

1. Connect to the portal by browsing to [Workshop Studio](https://catalog.us-east-1.prod.workshops.aws/workshops/f6b4587e-b8a5-4a43-be87-26bd85a70aba/en-US).
2. Sign in by clicking on the `Email one-time password (OTP)` button.
3. Enter your email address in the text box, and click **Send Passcode**. You should receive a passcode within 5 minutes. Enter the passcode in the text box, and click **Sign in***.
4. Enter the `Event access code` in the text box, and click **Next** 
5. Review the `Terms and Conditions` and check the `I agree with the Terms and Conditions` box, and click **Join event** 
6. In the left panel, click **Open AWS console** 

You are now logged in to the AWS console in an account that was created for you, and will be available only throughout the workshop run time.

In the interest of time we have deployed everything required to run Karpenter for this workshop. All the pre-requisites and dependencies have been deployed. The resources deployed can befound in this CloudFormation Template (**[eks-spot-workshop-quickstarter-cnf.yml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/awslabs/ec2-spot-workshops/master/content/using_ec2_spot_instances_with_eks/010_prerequisites/prerequisites.files/eks-spot-workshop-quickstart-cnf.yml)**). The template deploys resourcess such as (a) An [AWS Cloud9](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloud9) workspace with all the dependencies and IAM privileges to run the workshop (b) An EKS Cluster with the name `eksworkshop-eksctl` and (c) a [EKS managed node group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/managed-node-groups.html)  with 2 on-demand instances.

It is recommended that you keep this tab / window open so you can easily refer to the outputs and resources throughout the workshop.

{{% notice info %}}
you will notice additional Cloudformation stacks were also deployed which is the result of the stack that starts with **mod-**. One to deploy the Cloud9 Workspace and two other to create the EKS cluster and managed nodegroup.

### Validate the IAM role {#validate_iam}

Use the [GetCallerIdentity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/sts/get-caller-identity.html) CLI command to validate that the Cloud9 IDE is using the correct IAM role.
