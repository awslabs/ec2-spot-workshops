## Finished!

Congratulations on completing the lab...*or at least giving it a good go!* This is the workshop's permanent home, so feel free to revisit as often as you'd like. In typical Amazon fashion, we'll be listening to your feedback and iterating to make it better. If you have feedback, we're all ears! Make sure you clean up after the workshop, so you don't have any unexpected charges on your next monthly bill.


## Workshop Cleanup

*  Delete any manually created resources throughout the labs.
*  Delete any data files stored on S3 and container images stored in ECR.
*  Delete the CloudFormation stack launched at the beginning of the workshop.
