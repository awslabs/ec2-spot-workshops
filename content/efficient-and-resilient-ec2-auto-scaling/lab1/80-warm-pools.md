## Warm pools

A warm pool is a pool of pre-initialized EC2 instances that sits alongside an Auto Scaling group. Whenever your application needs to scale out, gives you the ability to decrease latency for your applications that have exceptionally long boot times.

**Set the warm pool size:**

It's important to decide how to set the **warm pools size** as it will make huge difference in associated cost.

1. By default and in this step, **warm pool size** is the difference between the number of currently running instances and the maximum capacity.
2. However if you're running a large Auto Scaling group that won't be the best cost optimized option, in that case you can set a **maximum prepared capacity** which counts current running instances as part of it.
3. You can also set a static number as the **minimum pool size** to ensure that there is always a certain number of warmed instances available to handle traffic spikes.

You can keep instances in the warm pool in one of **three** states: **Stopped**, **Running**, or **Hibernated** (if supported by the instance type).
Keeping instances in a **Stopped** state is an effective way to **minimize costs**. With stopped instances, you pay only for the volumes that you use and the Elastic IP addresses attached to the instances.

By default when ASG scales in instances it get **terminated** but in warm pools, you can configure **reuse** policy to return instances to warm pool.

**Limitations**:
You cannot add a warm pool to Auto Scaling groups that have a mixed instances policy or that launch Spot Instances.

#### Add warm pools to the Auto Scaling Group

In this step, you add a warm pool to your Auto Scaling group to pre-initialize your instances, so that instances can be brought into service more rapidly.

You want to keep your warm pool instances in a stopped state after they have completed their initialization actions. You will set the optional warm pool sizing parameters `--min-size` to 2 and leave `--max-group-prepared-capacity` empty. This means that this warm pool has a minimum size of 2 and a maximum prepared capacity equal to the max size of the Auto Scaling group. The maximum prepared capacity includes instances launched into the Auto Scaling group, and instances launched into the warm pool.

```bash
aws autoscaling put-warm-pool --auto-scaling-group-name "ec2-workshop-asg" --pool-state Stopped --min-size 2
```

**Now let's check the warm pool in the AWS Console**

1. **Navigate** to the [Auto Scaling console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/autoscaling/home#AutoScalingGroups:view=details), click on Auto Scaling group `ec2-workshop-asg`
2. Click on tab **Instance management**
3. A warm pool has been created and the instances have started initiating, note the current lifecycle for the instances is **Warmed:Pending:Wait**
4. Once the instances are initialized, the lifecycle will be changed to **Warmed:Stopped**
