In this section, you launch an instance directly into an Auto Scaling group. The Auto Scaling group you created `ec2-workshop-asg` uses lifecycle hooks to manage the application installation process.

As a part of initial set up with CloudFormation, you created a launch template with user data script. This script is executed on the instance during the the boot up, to install and starts the application. Once the application is installed, another command is executed to complete the lifecycle action and allow the instance to transition to the next lifecycle step.

#### Pausing scaling before next activity

To ensure that no instances are added or removed by the Auto Scaling policies you created earlier, in this step you will **pause** the predictive scaling and reset desired capacity to 0.

1. In AWS Console window, navigate to [EC2 Auto Scaling](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/autoscaling/home#AutoScalingGroups:view=details).
2. Click on tab **Automatic scaling**
3. Under **Predictive scaling policies**, find policy `workshop-predictive-scaling-policy` and turn off toggle **Scaling based on forecast**.
4. Click **Yes, turn off scaling** in the confirmation message.
5. To ensure the accuracy of this activity guide, you need to stop instances that are already running. In **Cloud9 IDE** terminal, run this command to ensure current capacity is set to **0** instances and **wait two minutes** to get all running instances terminated.
    ```bash
    aws autoscaling set-desired-capacity --auto-scaling-group-name "ec2-workshop-asg" --desired-capacity 0
    ```

#### Increase desired capacity

**Set** the desired capacity of the Auto Scaling group to **1** to launch an instance directly into the Auto Scaling group.

```bash
aws autoscaling set-desired-capacity --auto-scaling-group-name "ec2-workshop-asg" --desired-capacity 1
```
**Watch the instance being launched in the AWS Console**

1. **Navigate** to the [Auto Scaling console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/autoscaling/home#AutoScalingGroups:view=details), click on Auto Scaling group `ec2-workshop-asg`
2. Click on tab **Instance management**

#### Measure launch speed

You need to wait a few minutes for the instance to be launched by the previous step. Then run this script to measure the launch speed of the instance.

```bash
activities=$(aws autoscaling describe-scaling-activities --auto-scaling-group-name "ec2-workshop-asg" | jq -r '.Activities[0]') && \
start_time=$(date -d "$(echo $activities | jq -r '.StartTime')" "+%s") && \
end_time=$(date -d "$(echo $activities | jq -r '.EndTime')" "+%s") && \
activity=$(echo $activities | jq -r '.Description') && \
echo $activity Duration: $(($end_time - $start_time))"s" || echo "Current activity is still in progress.."
```

#### Observe launch duration

Because the instance launched directly into the Auto Scaling group, all initialization actions needed to complete to prepare the instance to be placed in-service. From the results below you can see that these actions took a **long time** to complete, delaying how quickly your Auto Scaling group can scale and **increases** the application response time.
