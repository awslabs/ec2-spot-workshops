## 2. Configure predictive scaling policy using custom CloudWatch metrics

In a predictive scaling policy, you can use predefined or custom metrics. Custom metrics are useful when the predefined metrics (CPU, network I/O, and Application Load Balancer request count) do not sufficiently describe your application load.

For the load metric specification, the most useful metric is a metric that represents the load on an Auto Scaling group as a whole, regardless of the group's capacity.And for the scaling metric specification, the most useful metric to scale by is an average throughput or utilization per instance metric.

## 3. Preload CloudWatch metrics data

If you're creating a new auto scaling group for every time you deploy your application, predictive scaling needs at least 24 hours of metrics data and for this reason we will be loading data into custom CloudWatch metrics to be used for forecasting capacity for this auto scaling group.

### Prepare custom metric data: scaling metric

As part of the CloudFormation stack you created, a bash script has been executed to update two metric data files which will be used to push data into CloudWatch metrics.

Verify metrics data files have been updated, 
* Cloud9 IDE
* Navigate to folder workshop/
* Check files 
* it should include today's date in UTC format and the auto scaling group name


**Export metric data**

```bash
aws cloudwatch get-metric-data --cli-input-json file://query-instances.json | jq '.MetricDataResults[].Values' > instances-results.json
```

```bash
aws cloudwatch get-metric-data --cli-input-json file://query-cpu.json | jq '.MetricDataResults[].Values' > cpu-results.json
```


{{% notice note %}}
By default, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling doesn't scale your EC2 capacity higher than your defined maximum capacity. However, it might be helpful to let it scale higher with slightly more capacity to avoid performance or availability issues.

Pre-launch instances, choose how far in advance you want your instances launched before the forecast calls for the load to increase.

When working with predictive scaling and custom metric, you have the option to choose pre-configured pair of metrics or go completely custom metrics for scaling,
load, capacity metrics.

{{% notice info %}}
A core assumption of predictive scaling is that the Auto Scaling group is homogenous and all instances are of equal capacity. If this isnâ€™t true for your group, forecasted capacity can be inaccurate.
