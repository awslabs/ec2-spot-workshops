## Overview

This workshop is designed to get you familiar with the concepts and best practices for predicting Amazon EC2 capacity needed for workloads running with Auto Scaling groups.

## Estimated workshop length

45-60 minutes

## Setting

You've been tasked with optimizing auto-scaling for an application behind a load balancer.

Requirements include the ability to automatically scale the service for traffic patterns, all without breaking the budget.

In order to effectively and efficiently scale, you will use [Predictive Scaling for EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-predictive-scaling-for-ec2-powered-by-machine-learning/) and [EC2 Warm Pools](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/scaling-your-applications-faster-with-ec2-auto-scaling-warm-pools/).
