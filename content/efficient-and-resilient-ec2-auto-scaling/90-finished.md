**Congratulations** on completing the workshop...*or at least giving it a good go*!  This is the workshop's permanent home, so feel free to revisit as often as you'd like.  In typical Amazon fashion, we'll be listening to your feedback and iterating to make it better.  If you have feedback, we're all ears!

**This is what you have accomplished in this workshop:**

1. Learned about the different types of scaling in Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling groups when to use each one.
2. Configured and applied auto scaling policies to increase application efficiency.
3. Learned and used lifecycle hooks and warm pools to improve application resiliency, and making it ready to handle peak and spike demands.
