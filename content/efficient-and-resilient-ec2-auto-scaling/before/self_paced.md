To complete this workshop, you need access to an AWS account with administrative permissions. An IAM user with administrator IAM access policy (**arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess**) or equivalent IAM access policy is required.

#### Deploy CloudFormation Stack
To save time on the initial setup, you deploy a **CloudFormation** template to create various supporting resources including IAM policies and roles, EC2 Launch Template, VPC, Subnets and a Cloud9 IDE environment for you to run the steps for the workshop in.

1. You can view and download the CloudFormation template from GitHub [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/awslabs/ec2-spot-workshops/master/content/efficient-and-resilient-ec2-auto-scaling/files/efficient-auto-scaling-quickstart-cnf.yml). (**Tip:** `Right click` the link and `Save Link As`, to download the file.). Take a moment to review the CloudFormation template so you understand the resources it will be creating.
1. Browse to the [AWS CloudFormation console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation) and click **Create stack**, then **With new resources(standard)**.
1. In the **Specify template** section, select **Upload a template file**. Click **Choose file** and, select the template you downloaded in step 1 and click **Next**.
1. In the **Specify stack details** section, enter a **Stack name** and click **Next**. (**Tip:** The stack name cannot contain space, use `myEC2Workshop` for example.)
1. In **Configure stack options**, you don't need to make any changes and click **Next**.
1. Review the information for the stack. At the bottom under **Capabilities**, select **I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources**. When you're satisfied with the settings, click **Create stack**.

{{% notice note %}}
The CloudFormation stack takes about **45 minutes** for the environment setup and the bootstrap script to finish creating the CloudWatch metrics data.

1. In the stack details pane, click the **Events** tab.
1. Click the refresh button to update the events in the stack creation
1. When AWS CloudFormation has successfully created the stack, you will see the **CREATE_COMPLETE** event at the top of the Events tab.
1. In the stack details pane, click the **Outputs** tab.
1. Click on the url of the AWS Cloud9 environment, it's the value of **Cloud9IDE** in the CloudFormation stack outputs.

1. In the **Cloud9 IDE**, check the folders in left navigation, look for folder named **ec2-spot-workshops**, confirm it **exists**.
1. In the Cloud9 terminal, change into the workshop directory
	```bash
	cd ec2-spot-workshops/workshops/efficient-and-resilient-ec2-auto-scaling
	```
