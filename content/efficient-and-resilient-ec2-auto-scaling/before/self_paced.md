### Running the workshop self-paced, in your own AWS account


To complete this workshop, have access to an AWS account with administrative permissions. An IAM user with administrator access (**arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess**) will do nicely.

Continue with [**Setup with CloudFormation**](/efficient-and-resilient-ec2-auto-scaling/before/self_paced/launch_cloudformation.html)

To avoid unwanted costs in your account, don't forget to go through the [**Cleanup step**](/efficient-and-resilient-ec2-auto-scaling/cleanup.html) when you finish the workshop, or if you deploy the CloudFormation template but don't complete the workshop.
