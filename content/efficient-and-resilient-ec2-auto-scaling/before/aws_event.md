### Login to the AWS Workshop Portal

If you are at an AWS event, an AWS account was created for you to use throughout the workshop. You will need the **Participant Hash** provided to you by the event's organizers.

1. Connect to the portal by browsing to [https://dashboard.eventengine.run/](https://dashboard.eventengine.run/). **Tip:** Right click the link and Open in a Private Browser Window.
2. Enter the Hash in the text box, and click **Proceed** 
3. In the User Dashboard screen, click **AWS Console** 
4. In the popup page, click **Open Console** 

You are now logged in to the AWS console in an account that was created for you, and will be available only throughout the workshop run time.
