### Launch the CloudFormation stack

To save time on the initial setup, a CloudFormation template will be used to create the Amazon VPC with subnets in two Availability Zones, as well as various supporting resources including IAM policies and roles, security groups, and a Cloud9 IDE environment for you to run the steps for the workshop in.

#### To create the stack

1. You can view and download the CloudFormation template from GitHub [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/awslabs/ec2-spot-workshops/master/workshops/ec2-auto-scaling-with-multiple-instance-types-and-purchase-options/ec2-auto-scaling-with-multiple-instance-types-and-purchase-options.yaml).
                                                                            
1. Take a moment to review the CloudFormation template so you understand the resources it will be creating.

1. Browse to the [AWS CloudFormation console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation).

1. In the **Specify stack details** section, enter a **Stack name**. For example, use *myEC2Workshop*. The stack name cannot contain spaces.

1. [Optional] In the **Parameters** section, optionally change the **sourceCidr** to restrict instance ssh/http access and load balancer http access.

1. Click **Next**.

1. In **Configure stack options**, you don't need to make any changes.

1. Click **Next**.

1. Review the information for the stack. At the bottom under **Capabilities**, select **I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources**. When you're satisfied with the settings, click **Create stack**.

#### Monitor the progress of stack creation

It will take roughly 5 minutes for the stack creation to complete.

1. On the [AWS CloudFormation console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation), select the stack in the list.

1. In the stack details pane, click the **Events** tab. You can click the refresh button to update the events in the stack creation.
 
The **Events** tab displays each major step in the creation of the stack sorted by the time of each event, with latest events on top.

The **CREATE\_IN\_PROGRESS** event is logged when AWS CloudFormation reports that it has begun to create the resource. The **CREATE_COMPLETE** event is logged when the resource is successfully created.

When AWS CloudFormation has successfully created the stack, you will see the **CREATE_COMPLETE** event at the top of the Events tab:

#### Use your stack resources

In this workshop, you'll need to reference the resources created by the CloudFormation stack.

1. On the [AWS CloudFormation console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation), select the stack in the list.

1. In the stack details pane, click the **Outputs** tab.

It is recommended that you keep this window open so you can easily refer to the outputs and resources throughout the workshop.
