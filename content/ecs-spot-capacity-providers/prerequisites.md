To run through this workshop we expect you to have some familiarity with [Docker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software)), AWS, any container orchestration tools such as [Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/Welcome.html), [Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/), [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/). During the workshop you will be using [AWS Cloud9](https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/) IDE to run [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) commands. Use the AWS region that is specified by the facilitator when running this workshop at AWS hosted event. You may use any AWS region while running it self-paced mode on your own AWS account.

## Conventions:

Throughout this workshop, we provide commands for you to run in the terminal. These commands will look like this:

<pre>
$ ssh -i PRIVATE_KEY.PEM ec2-user@EC2_PUBLIC_DNS_NAME
</pre>

The command starts after `$`.  Words that are ***UPPER_ITALIC_BOLD*** indicate a value that is unique to your environment.  For example, the ***PRIVATE\_KEY.PEM*** refers to the private key of an SSH key pair that you've created, and the ***EC2\_PUBLIC\_DNS\_NAME*** is a value that is specific to an EC2 instance launched in your account.  

## General requirements and notes: 
 
1. This workshop is self-paced. The instructions will walk you through achieving the workshopâ€™s learning objective using the AWS Management Console and CLI.

2. While the workshop provides step by step instructions, *please do take a moment to look around and understand what is happening at each step* as this will enhance your learning experience. The workshop is meant as a getting started guide, but you will learn the most by digesting each of the steps and thinking about how they would apply in your own environment and in your own organization. You can even consider experimenting with the steps to challenge yourself.
