Launch the CloudFormation stack 
---

To save time on the initial setup, a CloudFormation template will be used to create the required resources needed for the workshop.

1. You can view and download the CloudFormation template from GitHub [here, Change location before making it live] (https://github.com/ec2-spot-workshops/workshops/ecs-spot-capacity-providers/ecs-spot-workshop-cfn.yaml).
2. Take a moment to review the CloudFormation template so you understand the resources it will be creating.
3. Browse to the [AWS CloudFormation console] (https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation). Make sure you are in AWS region designated by the facilitators of the workshop
4. Click *Create stack*.
5. In the *Specify template* section, select *Upload a template file*. Click *Choose file* and, select the template you downloaded in step 1.
6. Click *Next*.
7. In the *Specify stack details* section, enter **ECSSpotWorkshop** as *Stack name*.
8. [Optional] In the *Parameters* section, optionally change the *sourceCidr* to restrict instance ssh/http access and load balancer http access.
9. Click *Next*.
10. In *Configure stack options*, you don’t need to make any changes.
11. Click *Next*.
12. Review the information for the stack. At the bottom under *Capabilities*, select *I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources*. When you’re satisfied with the settings, click *Create stack*.

Monitor the progress of stack creation 
---

It will take roughly 5 minutes for the stack creation to complete.

1. On the [AWS CloudFormation console] (https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation), select the stack in the list.
2. In the stack details pane, click the *Events* tab. You can click the refresh button to update the events in the stack creation.

The *Events* tab displays each major step in the creation of the stack sorted by the time of each event, with latest events on top.
The *CREATE_IN_PROGRESS* event is logged when AWS CloudFormation reports that it has begun to create the resource. The *CREATE_COMPLETE* event is logged when the resource is successfully created.
When AWS CloudFormation has successfully created the stack, you will see the *CREATE_COMPLETE* event at the top of the Events tab:

Take a moment and check out all the resources created by this stack.

The CloudFormation template creates the following resources which we will be using later during the workshop.


* One VPC with 3 public and 3 private subnets.
* Application Load Balancer (ALB) with its own security group.
* Target Group (TG) and an ALB listener to forward the traffic to this TG.
* IAM Role for the Cloud9 Environment.
* Security Group for the ECS Container Instances.
* EC2 Launch Template configured with the ECS optimized AMI, and ECS bootstrapping configuration in the user data section to bootstrap the EC2 Instances into the ECS cluster.
* ECR Repository to host our containers.
