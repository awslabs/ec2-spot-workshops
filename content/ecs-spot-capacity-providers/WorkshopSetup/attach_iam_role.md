In order to work with ECS from our new Cloud9 IDE environment, we will need the appropriate permissions.

* Find your Cloud9 EC2 instance [here] (https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?#Instances)

* Select the instance, then choose Actions -> Instance Settings -> Attach/Replace IAM Role
* Choose **EcsSpotWorkshop-Cloud9InstanceProfile** from the *IAM Role* drop down, and select *Apply*

* Click on the *Settings* icon on the top right
* Select *AWS SETTINGS* 
* Turn off *AWS managed temporary credentials* 
* Close the Preferences tab

Use the [GetCallerIdentity] (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/sts/get-caller-identity.html) CLI command to validate that the Cloud9 IDE is using the correct IAM role.

```
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

The output assumed-role name should contain the name of the role.

```

}
```
