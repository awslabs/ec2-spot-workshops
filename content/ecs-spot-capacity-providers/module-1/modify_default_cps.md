Also note the default capacity provider strategy used in the above command. It sets base=2 and weight=1 for On-demand ASG CP and weight of 3 for CP-SPOT. That means, ECS will first place 2 tasks (since base=2) on CP-OD and split the remaining tasks between CP-OD and CP-SOT in 1:3 ratio, which means that for every 1 task on CP-OD, 3 will be placed on CP-SPOT.

You can override this default Capacity Provider strategy and specify a different strategy for each service independently.
