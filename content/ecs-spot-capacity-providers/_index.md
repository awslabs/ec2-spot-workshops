## Overview

Welcome! In this workshop you learn how to **cost optimize** your Amazon ECS clusters using EC2 Spot Instances.

The **learning objective** of this hands-on workshop is to help understand the different options to cost optimize container workloads running on **[Amazon ECS](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/)** using **[EC2 Spot Instances](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/)** and **[Amazon Fargate Spot](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/)**. This workshop covers topics such as ECS cluster auto scaling and how to scale efficiently with **[Capacity Providers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/cluster-capacity-providers.html)** to spread your tasks across a mix of resources, both on AWS Fargate and AWS Fargate Spot as well as EC2 On-Demand and Spot Instances.
