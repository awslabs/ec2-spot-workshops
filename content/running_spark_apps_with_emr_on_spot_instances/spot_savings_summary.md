When our cluster has finished bootstrapping and the Spark application is running or has already completed, we can have a look at how much we are saving by running Spot Instances. The Spot Savings Summary feature in the EC2 Spot console provides a current snapshot of the Spot Instances in our account, and the current savings.

1. Open the AWS Management console and go to the EC2 Service in the region where you are running your EMR cluster. 
2. On the left pane, click **Spot Requests**.
3. In the main pane, click **Savings Summary**.
