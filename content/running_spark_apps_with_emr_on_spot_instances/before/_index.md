# Getting Started
To start the workshop, follow one of the following depending on whether you are...

* ...[attending an AWS hosted event (using AWS provided hashes)]({{< ref "/running_spark_apps_with_emr_on_spot_instances/before/aws_event.md" >}}), or
* ...[running the workshop on your own (in your own account)]({{< ref "/running_spark_apps_with_emr_on_spot_instances/before/self_paced.md" >}})

Once you are done with either setup, continue with [**EMR Instance Fleets**](/running_spark_apps_with_emr_on_spot_instances/emr_instance_fleets.html)
