### Running the workshop self-paced, in your own AWS account

\
To complete this workshop, have access to an AWS account with administrative permissions. An IAM user with administrator access (**arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess**) will do nicely.

You can start the workshop by heading to [**Prerequisites and initial steps**](/running_spark_apps_with_emr_on_spot_instances/prerequisites_notes.html)

To avoid unwanted costs in your account, don't forget to go through the [**Conclusions and Cleanup step**](/running_spark_apps_with_emr_on_spot_instances/conclusions_and_cleanup.html#eventorownaccount-1) when you finish the workshop.
