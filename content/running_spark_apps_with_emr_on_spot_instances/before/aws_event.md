### Running the workshop at an AWS Event

{{% notice warning %}}
Only complete this section if you are at an AWS hosted event such as re:Invent, public workshop, Immersion Day, or any other event hosted by an AWS employee. If you are running the workshop on your own, then go to [Start the workshop on your own](/running_spark_apps_with_emr_on_spot_instances/self_paced.html) directly.

### Login to the AWS Workshop Portal

If you are at an AWS event, an AWS account was created for you to use throughout the workshop. You will need the **Participant Hash** provided to you by the event's organizers.

1. Connect to the portal by browsing to [https://dashboard.eventengine.run/](https://dashboard.eventengine.run/).
2. Enter the Hash in the text box, and click **Proceed** 
3. In the User Dashboard screen, click **AWS Console** 
4. In the popup page, click **Open Console** 

You are now logged in to the AWS console in an account that was created for you, and will be available only throughout the workshop run time.

 The workshop requires an [AWS Cloud9](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloud9) workspace and a S3 buckets as the prerequisites. To save time these pre-requisites and dependencies have been already deployed using this CloudFormation Template (**[emr-spark-spot-workshop-quickstarter-cnf.yml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/awslabs/ec2-spot-workshops/master/workshops/running_spark_apps_with_emr_on_spot_instances/emr-spark-spot-workshop-quickstarter-cnf.yaml)**).

#### Getting access to Cloud9  

In this workshop, you'll need to reference the resources created by the CloudFormation stack.

1. On the [AWS CloudFormation console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation), select the stack name that starts with **mod-** in the list.

2. In the stack details pane, click the **Outputs** tab.

It is recommended that you keep this tab / window open so you can easily refer to the outputs and resources throughout the workshop.

You will notice an additional Cloudformation stack was also deployed to deploy the Cloud9 Workspace, which is the result of the stack that starts with **mod-**.

#### Launch your Cloud9 workspace

{{% notice tip %}}
Ad blockers, javascript disablers, and tracking blockers should be disabled for
the cloud9 domain, or connecting to the workspace might be impacted.
Cloud9 requires third-party-cookies. You can whitelist the [specific domains]( https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/latest/user-guide/troubleshooting.html#troubleshooting-env-loading).
