{{% notice note %}}
If you're running in an account that was created for you as part of an AWS event, there's no need to go through the cleanup stage - the account will be closed automatically. \
If you're running in your own account, make sure you run through these steps to make sure you don't encounter unwanted costs.

## Cleaning up HPA, CA, and the Microservice
```
cd ~/environment
kubectl delete hpa monte-carlo-pi-service
kubectl delete -f monte-carlo-pi-service.yaml
kubectl delete -f inflate-arm64.yaml
kubectl delete -f inflate-amd64.yaml
kubectl delete -f inflate-team1.yaml
kubectl delete -f inflate-spot.yaml
kubectl delete -f inflate.yaml
helm uninstall aws-node-termination-handler --namespace kube-system
helm uninstall karpenter -namespace karpenter
helm uninstall kube-ops-view
kubectl delete -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server/releases/download/v0.6.0/components.yaml
```

## Removing the cluster, Managed node groups and Karpenter pre-requisites
```
aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name Karpenter-eksworkshop-eksctl
eksctl delete cluster -f eksworkshop.yaml
```

## Delete SSH Key Pair and Cloud 9
```
aws ec2 delete-key-pair --key-name eksworkshop
CLOUD_9_IDS=$(aws cloud9 list-environments | jq -c ".environmentIds | flatten(0)" | sed -E -e 's/\[|\]|\"|//g' | sed 's/,/ /g')
CLOUD_9_WORKSHOP_ID=$(aws cloud9 describe-environments --environment-ids $CLOUD_9_IDS | jq '.environments | .[] | select(.name=="eksworkshop") | .id ' | sed -e 's/\"//g')
aws cloud9 delete-environment --environment-id $CLOUD_9_WORKSHOP_ID
```

{{% notice tip %}}
If you get any error while running this command, perhaps it might be caused because the name you selected for your cloud9 environment is different from **eksworkshop**. You can either find out and replace the name in the commands with the right name or [Use the console to delete the environment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloud9/latest/user-guide/delete-environment.html).
