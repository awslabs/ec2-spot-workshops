1. Within JupyterLab (Which you opened in the previous steps), navigate to the ***/ec2-spot-labs/ec2-spot-sagemaker-managed-spot-training/*** folder.

2. Double-click on a Notebook and complete each step outlined in the Notebook. Each available lab comes in the form of a separate Notebook. Locate the labs you are interested in running and complete each step documented in the notebook.  ![SageMaker Notebook Instance](/images/using-sagemaker-managed-spot-training/jupyter-3.png)

3. You can execute each step of the notebook by clicking the 'Run' button, highlighted in orange in the image below. This will execute the selected cell, identified by the blue box to the left of the active cell and advance to the next cell. If you're new to Jupyter Notebooks, you should take a look at the following guide for more information: [How To Use Jupyter Notebooks](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/how-to-use-jupyter-notebooks) ![SageMaker Notebook Instance](/images/using-sagemaker-managed-spot-training/jupyter-4.png)

4. If you're looking for a basic example notebook to begin with we recommend starting with the sagemaker-built-in-deepar as this notebook is quickly executed and demonstrates the core functionality of Managed Spot Training.
