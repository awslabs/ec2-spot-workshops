### Running the workshop at an AWS Event

{{% notice warning %}}
Only complete this section if you are at an AWS hosted event (such as re:Invent,
Kubecon, Immersion Day, or any other event hosted by an AWS employee). If you 
are running the workshop on your own, go to: [Start the workshop on your own]({{< ref "/using_ec2_spot_instances_with_eks/010_prerequisites/self_paced.md" >}}).

### Login to the AWS Workshop Portal

If you are at an AWS event, an AWS account was created for you to use throughout the workshop. You will need the **Participant Hash** provided to you by the event's organizers.

1. Connect to the portal by browsing to [https://dashboard.eventengine.run/](https://dashboard.eventengine.run/).
2. Enter the Hash in the text box, and click **Proceed** 
3. In the User Dashboard screen, click **AWS Console** 
4. In the popup page, click **Open Console** 

You are now logged in to the AWS console in an account that was created for you, and will be available only throughout the workshop run time.

In the interest of time for shorter events we sometimes deploy the resources required as a prerequisite for you. If you were told so, please review the cloudformation outputs of the stack that was deployed by **expanding the instructions below**.

#### What resources are already deployed {#resources_deployed}

We have deployed the below resources required to get started with the workshop using a CloudFormation Template (**[eks-spot-workshop-quickstarter-cnf.yml] (prerequisites.files/eks-spot-workshop-quickstart-cnf.yml)**), Please reference the below  resources created by the stack.

+ An [AWS Cloud9](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloud9) workspace with
    - An IAM role created and attached to the workspace with Administrator access
    - Kubernetes tools installed (kubectl, jq and envsubst)
    - awscli upgraded to v2
    - Created and imported a key pair to Amazon EC2
    - [eksctl](https://eksctl.io/) installed, The official CLI for Amazon EKS

#### Use your resources 

In this workshop, you'll need to reference the resources created by the CloudFormation stack that we setup for you.

1. On the [AWS CloudFormation console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation), select the stack name that starts with **mod-** in the list.

1. In the stack details pane, click the **Outputs** tab.

It is recommended that you keep this window open so you can easily refer to the outputs and resources throughout the workshop.

{{% notice info %}}
you will notice additional Cloudformation stacks were also deployed which is the result of the stack that starts with **mod-**. One to deploy the Cloud9 Workspace and two other to create the EKS cluster and managed nodegroup.

#### Launch your Cloud9 workspace

- Click on the url against `Cloud9IDE` from the outputs

{{% insert-md-from-file file="using_ec2_spot_instances_with_eks/010_prerequisites/update_workspace_settings.md" %}}

### Validate the IAM role {#validate_iam}

Use the [GetCallerIdentity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/sts/get-caller-identity.html) CLI command to validate that the Cloud9 IDE is using the correct IAM role.

```
aws sts get-caller-identity

```

{{% notice note %}}
Since we have already setup the prerequisites, **you can head straight to [Test the Cluster]({{<  relref "/using_ec2_spot_instances_with_eks/020_eksctl/test.md"  >}})**
