# Getting Started
To start the workshop, follow one of the following depending on whether you are...

* ...[running the workshop on your own (in your own account)]({{< ref "/using_ec2_spot_instances_with_eks/010_prerequisites/self_paced.md" >}}), or
* ...[attending an AWS hosted event (using AWS provided hashes)]({{< ref "/using_ec2_spot_instances_with_eks/010_prerequisites/aws_event.md" >}})

Once you have completed with either setup, continue with **[Create a Workspace]({{< ref "/using_ec2_spot_instances_with_eks/010_prerequisites/workspace.md" >}})**
