Now that we have helm installed, we are ready to use the stable helm catalog and install tools 
that will help with understanding our cluster setup in a visual way. The first of those tools that we are going to install is [Kube-ops-view](https://github.com/hjacobs/kube-ops-view) from Henning Jacobs.

The following line updates the stable helm repository and then installs kube-ops-view using a LoadBalancer Service type and creating a RBAC (Resource Base Access Control) entry for the read-only service account to read nodes and pods information from the cluster.

```
helm repo update
helm install stable/kube-ops-view --name kube-ops-view --set service.type=LoadBalancer --set rbac.create=True
```

The execution above installs kube-ops-view  exposing it through a Service using the LoadBalancer type.
A successful execution of the command will display the set of resources created and will prompt some advice asking you to use `kubectl proxy` and a local URL for the service. Given we are using the type LoadBalancer for our service, we can disregard this; Instead we will point our browser to the external load balancer.

{{% notice warning %}}
Monitoring and visualization shouldn't be typically be exposed publicly unless the service is properly secured and provide methods for authentication and authorization. You can still deploy kube-ops-view using a Service of type **ClusterIP** by removing the  `--set service.type=LoadBalancer` section and using `kubectl proxy`. Kube-ops-view does also [support Oauth 2](https://github.com/hjacobs/kube-ops-view#configuration)

To check the chart was installed successfully:

```
helm list
```

should display : 
```
NAME            REVISION        UPDATED                         STATUS          CHART                   APP VERSION     NAMESPACE
kube-ops-view   1               Sun Sep 22 11:47:31 2019        DEPLOYED        kube-ops-view-1.1.0     0.11            default  
```

With this we can explore kube-ops-view output by checking the details about the newly service created. 

```
kubectl get svc kube-ops-view | tail -n 1 | awk '{ print "Kube-ops-view URL = http://"$4 }'
```

This will display a line similar to `Kube-ops-view URL = http://<URL_PREFIX_ELB>.amazonaws.com`
Opening the URL in your browser will provide the current state of our cluster.

You may need to refresh the page and clean your browser cache. The creation and setup of the LoadBalancer may take a few minutes; usually in two minutes you should see kub-ops-view.

As this workshop moves along and you create Spot workers, and perform scale up and down actions, you can check the effects and changes in the cluster using kube-ops-view. Check out the different components and see how they map to the concepts that we have already covered during this workshop.

{{% notice tip %}}
Spend some time checking the state and properties of your EKS cluster.
