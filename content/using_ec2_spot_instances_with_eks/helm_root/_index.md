# Kubernetes Helm

[Helm](https://helm.sh/) is a package manager for Kubernetes that packages multiple Kubernetes resources into a single logical deployment unit called **Chart**.

Helm is a tool that streamlines installing and managing Kubernetes applications. Think of it like apt/yum/homebrew for Kubernetes.

In this section we will deploy Helm the Kubernetes Package Manager. We will use Helm during the workshop to install other components out from the list of available charts.
