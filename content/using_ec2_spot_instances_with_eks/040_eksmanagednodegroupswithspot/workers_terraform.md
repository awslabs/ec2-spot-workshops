title: "Create EKS managed node groups with Spot capacity"
weight: 30
draft: false
---

In this section we will deploy the instance types we selected in previous chapter and create managed node groups that adhere to Spot diversification best practices. We will update the existing Terraform template used to create the cluster. **Remember to continue using your Cloud9 workspace to run all commands.**

Within the `main.tf` template file, there's a seccion within the `managed_node_groups` section with the following comment:

```
// ### -->> SPOT NODE GROUP GOES HERE <<--- ###
```

Just below that line, paste the following code snippet to create two Spot node groups:

```
    spot_4vcpu_16mem = {
      node_group_name = "mng-spot-4vcpu-16gb"
      capacity_type   = "SPOT"
      instance_types  = ["m4.xlarge", "m5.xlarge", "m5a.xlarge", "m5ad.xlarge", "m5d.xlarge", "t2.xlarge", "t3.xlarge", "t3a.xlarge"]
      max_size        = 4
      desired_size    = 2
      min_size        = 0

      subnet_type = "private"
      subnet_ids  = []

      k8s_taints = [{ key = "spotInstance", value = "true", effect = "PREFER_NO_SCHEDULE" }]
      k8s_labels = {
        intent = "apps"
      }
    },

    spot_8vcpu_32mem = {
      node_group_name = "mng-spot-8vcpu-32gb"
      capacity_type   = "SPOT"
      instance_types  = ["m4.2xlarge", "m5.2xlarge", "m5a.2xlarge", "m5ad.2xlarge", "m5d.2xlarge", "t2.2xlarge", "t3.2xlarge", "t3a.2xlarge"]
      max_size        = 2
      desired_size    = 1
      min_size        = 0

      subnet_type = "private"
      subnet_ids  = []

      k8s_taints = [{ key = "spotInstance", value = "true", effect = "PREFER_NO_SCHEDULE" }]
      k8s_labels = {
        intent = "apps"
      }
    }
```

Run a `terraform fmt` to fix any identation problem (if any), then run:

```
terraform apply --auto-approve
```

Creation of node groups will take 3-4 minutes. 
{{% /notice %}}

There are a few things to note in the configuration that we just used to create these node groups.

 * Node groups configurations are set under the **managed_node_groups** section, this indicates that the node groups are managed by EKS.
 * First node group has **xlarge** (4 vCPU and 16 GB) instance types with **min_size** 0, **max_size** 4 and **desired_size** 2.
 * Second node group has **2xlarge** (8 vCPU and 32 GB) instance types with **min_size** 0, **max_size** 2 and **desired_size** 1.
 * The configuration **capacity_type = "SPOT"** indicates that the node group being created is an EKS managed node group with Spot capacity.
 * We applied a **[Taint](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/taint-and-toleration/)** `k8s_taints = [{ key = "spotInstance", value = "true", effect = "PREFER_NO_SCHEDULE" }]`. **PREFER_NO_SCHEDULE** is used to indicate we prefer pods not be scheduled on Spot Instances. This is a “preference” or “soft” version of **NO_SCHEDULE** – the system will try to avoid placing a pod that does not tolerate the taint on the node, but it is not required.
 * Notice that the we added a node label **intent**, to allow you to deploy stateless applications on nodes that have been labeled with value **apps**

{{% notice info %}}
If you are wondering at this stage: *Where is spot bidding price ?* you are missing some of the changes EC2 Spot Instances had since 2017. Since November 2017 [EC2 Spot price changes infrequently](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/new-amazon-ec2-spot-pricing/) based on long term supply and demand of spare capacity in each pool independently. You can still set up a **maxPrice** in scenarios where you want to set maximum budget. By default *maxPrice* is set to the On-Demand price; Regardless of what the *maxPrice* value, Spot Instances will still be charged at the current Spot market price.

### Confirm the Nodes

{{% notice tip %}}
Aside from familiarizing yourself with the kubectl commands below to obtain the cluster information, you should also explore your cluster using **kube-ops-view** and find out the nodes that were just created.
{{% /notice %}}

Confirm that the new nodes joined the cluster correctly. You should see the nodes added to the cluster.

```
kubectl get nodes
```

Managed node groups automatically create a label **eks.amazonaws.com/capacityType** to identify which nodes are Spot Instances and which are On-Demand Instances so that we can schedule the appropriate workloads to run on Spot Instances. You can use this node label to identify the lifecycle of the nodes

```
kubectl get nodes \
  --label-columns=eks.amazonaws.com/capacityType \
  --selector=eks.amazonaws.com/capacityType=SPOT
```
The output of this command should return nodes running on Spot Instances. The output of the command shows the **CAPACITYTYPE** for the current nodes is set to **SPOT**.

```
NAME                                        STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION               CAPACITYTYPE
ip-10-0-11-190.eu-west-1.compute.internal   Ready    <none>   19m   v1.24.9-eks-49d8fe8   SPOT
ip-10-0-12-250.eu-west-1.compute.internal   Ready    <none>   19m   v1.24.9-eks-49d8fe8   SPOT
ip-10-0-12-48.eu-west-1.compute.internal    Ready    <none>   19m   v1.24.9-eks-49d8fe8   SPOT
```

Now we will show all nodes running on On Demand Instances. The output of the command shows the **CAPACITYTYPE** for the current nodes is set to **ON_DEMAND**.

```
kubectl get nodes \
  --label-columns=eks.amazonaws.com/capacityType \
  --selector=eks.amazonaws.com/capacityType=ON_DEMAND
```
```
NAME                                        STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION               CAPACITYTYPE
ip-10-0-10-122.eu-west-1.compute.internal   Ready    <none>   21d   v1.24.7-eks-fb459a0   ON_DEMAND
ip-10-0-11-109.eu-west-1.compute.internal   Ready    <none>   21d   v1.24.7-eks-fb459a0   ON_DEMAND
ip-10-0-12-119.eu-west-1.compute.internal   Ready    <none>   21d   v1.24.7-eks-fb459a0   ON_DEMAND
```
