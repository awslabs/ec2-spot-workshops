## Add Tolerations

In the previous chapter [Create EKS managed node groups with Spot capacity]({{< ref "/using_ec2_spot_instances_with_eks/040_eksmanagednodegroupswithspot/workers_terraform.md" >}}) we added a taint `spotInstance: "true:PreferNoSchedule"` to both node groups. **PreferNoSchedule** is used to indicate we prefer pods not to be scheduled on Spot Instances. **NoSchedule** can also be used to enforce a hard discrimination as a taint. To overcome this taint, we need to add a toleration in the deployment. Read about how [tolerations](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/taint-and-toleration/) are applied and modify the **monte-carlo-pi-service.yml** file accordingly.

As per the [tolerations](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/taint-and-toleration/) documentation 
the objective is to add the following section to the `monte-carlo-pi-service.yml`. 

The following toleration must be added at the *spec.template.spec* level

```
      tolerations: 
      - key: "spotInstance" 
        operator: "Equal" 
        value: "true" 
        effect: "PreferNoSchedule" 
```

## Add Affinities

Our next task before deployment is to add [affinities](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/#affinity-and-anti-affinity) to the configuration. 

In the previous chapters we labeled managed node groups with On-Demand capacity with **intent: control-apps** and managed node groups with Spot capacity with **intent: apps**. Additionally EKS adds a label **eks.amazonaws.com/capacityType** and sets its value to **ON_DEMAND** for node groups with On-Demand capacity and **SPOT** for node group with Spot capacity. 

To meet the requirements we defined in previous chapter: *application to be deployed only on nodes that have been labeled with `intent: apps`* and *application to prefer Spot Instances over on-demand Instances*, we need to add two affinity properties:

- a *requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution* affinity: also known as "hard" affinity that will limit our deployment to nodes label with **intent: apps** 
- a *preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution* affinity: also known as "soft" affinity that express our preference for nodes of a specific type. In this case Spot Instances labeled with **eks.amazonaws.com/capacityType: SPOT**.

Read about how affinities can be used to [assign pods to nodes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/#affinity-and-anti-affinity) and modify the **monte-carlo-pi-service.yml** file accordingly.

As per the [Assign Pods to Nodes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/assign-pod-node/#affinity-and-anti-affinity) documentation the objective is to add the following section to the `monte-carlo-pi-service.yml`. 

The following affinities must be added at the *spec.template.spec* level

```
      affinity: 
        nodeAffinity: 
          preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution: 
          - weight: 1 
            preference: 
              matchExpressions: 
              - key: eks.amazonaws.com/capacityType 
                operator: In 
                values: 
                - SPOT 
          requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution: 
            nodeSelectorTerms: 
            - matchExpressions: 
              - key: intent 
                operator: In 
                values: 
                - apps 
```
