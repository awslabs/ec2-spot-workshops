# Launch using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)

[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) is an infrastructure as code tool that lets you build, change, and version infrastructure safely and efficiently in AWS.

[EKS Blueprints for Terraform](https://github.com/aws-ia/terraform-aws-eks-blueprints) helps you compose complete EKS clusters that are fully bootstrapped with the operational software that is needed to deploy and operate workloads. With EKS Blueprints, you describe the configuration for the desired state of your EKS environment, such as the control plane, worker nodes, and Kubernetes add-ons, as an IaC blueprint. Once a blueprint is configured, you can use it to stamp out consistent environments across multiple AWS accounts and Regions using continuous deployment automation.

In this module, we will use EKS Blueprints for Terraform to launch and configure our EKS cluster and nodes.
