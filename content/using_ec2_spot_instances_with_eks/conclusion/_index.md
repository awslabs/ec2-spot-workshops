# Conclusion

**Congratulations!** you have reached the end of the workshop. In this workshop, you learned about the need to be flexible with EC2 instance types when using Spot Instances, applying EC2 Spot diversification best practices on Kubernetes / EKS using Cluster Autoscaler and Horizontal pod autoscaler.

You can continue your learning path by taking a look at the content and modules available at **[eksworkshop.com](https://eksworkshop.com/)**. Perhaps there are modules that you would like to try on spot instances !

Finally, we will appreciate any feedback, good or bad!, you may have about this workshop.
