Congratulations on completing the workshop...*or at least giving it a good go*!  This is the workshop's permanent home, so feel free to revisit as often as you'd like.  In typical Amazon fashion, we'll be listening to your feedback and iterating to make it better.  If you have feedback, we're all ears!  Make sure to go to the next step for the cleanup process, so you don't have any unexpected charges on your next monthly bill.  

## Check the savings you achieved

Before you clean up the resources, you can very easily check the savings you have achieved. To do so, go to the Spot Requests section of the [EC2 console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2sp/v2/home#/spot), and click on the `Savings summary` button. You'll see something similar to the below picture.
