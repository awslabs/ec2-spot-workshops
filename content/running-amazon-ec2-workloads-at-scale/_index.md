## Overview 
This workshop is designed to get you familiar with the concepts and best practices for requesting Amazon EC2 capacity at scale in a cost optimized architecture, leveraging Amazon EC2 Spot instances and EC2 Auto Scaling groups with mixed instance types and purchase options.

## Setting
You've been tasked with deploying a next-generation music streaming service. You do extensive research, and determine that [Koel](https://koel.phanan.net/)- a personal music streaming server (*that works)- is the perfect fit.

Requirements include the ability to automatically deploy and scale the service for both predictable and dynamic traffic patterns, all without breaking the budget.

In order to optimize performance and cost, you will use Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling to [scale across multiple instance types and purchase options](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-ec2-auto-scaling-groups-with-multiple-instance-types-purchase-options/).
