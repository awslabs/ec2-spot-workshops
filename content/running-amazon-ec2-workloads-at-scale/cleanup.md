{{% notice note %}}
If you're running in an account that was created for you as part of an AWS event, there's no need to go through the cleanup stage - the account will be closed automatically.\
If you're running in your own account, make sure you run through these steps to make sure you don't encounter unwanted costs.

1. Delete all manually created resources.

	```
	aws autoscaling delete-auto-scaling-group --auto-scaling-group-name runningAmazonEC2WorkloadsAtScale --force-delete
	
	aws deploy delete-deployment-group --application-name koelApp --deployment-group-name koelDepGroup
	
	aws deploy delete-application --application-name koelApp
	
	aws s3 rm s3://%codeDeployBucket% --recursive
		
	aws elbv2 delete-load-balancer --load-balancer-arn %loadBalancerArn%
	
	aws elbv2 delete-target-group --target-group-arn %targetGroupArn%
	
	aws rds delete-db-instance --db-instance-identifier runningAmazonEC2WorkloadsAtScale --skip-final-snapshot
	
	aws ec2 delete-launch-template --launch-template-name runningAmazonEC2WorkloadsAtScale
	```
	
1. Finally, delete the CloudFormation stack itself.
	
	```
	aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name runningAmazonEC2WorkloadsAtScale
	```
