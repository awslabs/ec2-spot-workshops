## Overview 
This workshop is designed to quickly get you familiar with the concepts and best practices for requesting Amazon EC2 capacity at scale in a cost optimized architecture.

## Note
This is a shortened version of [Running EC2 workloads at scale with EC2 Auto Scaling](https://ec2spotworkshops.com/running-amazon-ec2-workloads-at-scale.html). It is designed to cover the same best practices but within a shorter amount of time.

## Estimated workshop length
45-60 minutes

## Setting
You've been tasked with deploying a scalable web application behind a load balancer.

Requirements include the ability to automatically scale the service for dynamic traffic patterns, all without breaking the budget.

In order to optimize performance and cost, you will use Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling to [scale across multiple instance types and purchase options](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-ec2-auto-scaling-groups-with-multiple-instance-types-purchase-options/).
