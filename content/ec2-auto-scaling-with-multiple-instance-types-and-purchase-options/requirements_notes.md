1\. __This workshop is self-paced__. The instructions will primarily be given using the [AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)](https://aws.amazon.com/cli) - this way the guide will not become outdated as changes or updates are made to the AWS Management Console. However, most steps in the workshop can be done in the AWS Management Console directly. Feel free to use whatever is comfortable for you.

2\. While the workshop provides step by step instructions, please do take a moment to look around and understand what is happening at each step. The workshop is meant as a getting started guide, but you will learn the most by digesting each of the steps and thinking about how they would apply in your own environment. You might even consider experimenting with the steps to challenge yourself.

3\. This workshop has been designed to run in any public AWS Region that supports AWS Cloud9. See [Regional Products and Services](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/) for details.
