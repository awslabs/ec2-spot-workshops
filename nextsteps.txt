1. Use an AWS Batch array job https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/userguide/array_index_example.html 
2. Create an S3 file with the spot values, one spot per line - spotprices.txt 
3. Create an S3 file with the portfolio values, on [strike,notional] per line - portfolio.txt. Simplify to a single portfolio for initial development.
4. The montecarlo-price.sh script gets the appropriate row from the spotprices.txt file, then passes that as the command line param to the python script.

Then need to gather all of the results and combine into a set of PVs for the entire set of portfolios. Maybe do this in Step Functions, but maybe not?
